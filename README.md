# neighbourhood-map

## About

This project is a neighbourhood map of east Auckland, New Zealand and shows
many restaurants which I consider very good and would happily take others.

I created this app using Google's Maps API as a starting point, utilizing their
markers and info windows as I created a neighbourhood map of tasty places.

I also used Yelp's business API to display ratings of the restaurant if that's of
interest to anyone, but not all great restaurants are on Yelp since NZ is a small
country I've written my own descriptions, pricings and titles all using separation
of concerns in case I wish to expand my map or change the descriptions etc.

## How to run
